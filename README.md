# Graphical Perception Replication Study

This repository contains the research package for a graphical perception study comparing how accurately people estimate quantities from bar charts and pie charts.

The study is a replication and follow-up of Cleveland and McGill’s graphical perception work. It examines visual estimation across two related comparison tasks:

1. estimating one chart value as a percentage of another chart value;
2. estimating one chart value as a percentage of the whole chart.

The study is being conducted as part of a PhD Data Visualization research project at City St George’s, University of London, in collaboration with the University of Warwick.

## Study overview

Participants complete an online visual judgement task. They view a series of bar charts and pie charts and enter percentage estimates. The task is designed to compare judgement accuracy across chart types and comparison types.

The study focuses on two comparison conditions:

- **part-to-part comparison**: estimating one chart value as a percentage of another chart value;
- **part-to-whole comparison**: estimating one chart value as a percentage of the whole chart.

## Materials

The `materials/` folder contains participant information, consent materials, Qualtrics survey materials, study stimuli, and stimulus metadata.

## Ethics and preregistration

The `docs/` folder contains redacted ethics documentation, preregistration materials, a study decision log, and pilot notes.

Only redacted documents are included in this repository.

## Code

The `code/` folder contains scripts used to generate stimuli and analyze the anonymized study data.

## Data

The `data/anonymized/` folder contains the anonymized dataset used for analysis.

Raw data are not included in this repository.

## Reproducing the analysis

To reproduce the analysis:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the analysis scripts in `code/analysis/`.
3. Check that the data paths point to `data/anonymised/`.
4. Run the analysis script.
5. Compare generated outputs with the files in `outputs/`.
